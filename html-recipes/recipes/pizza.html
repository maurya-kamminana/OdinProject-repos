    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,
      flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese,
      and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions,
      olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature,
      traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a
      pizzetta.
