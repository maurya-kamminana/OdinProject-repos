    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat
      flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes,
      then cooked by boiling or baking. Pastas may be divided into two broad
      categories: dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca). Most dried pasta
      is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be
      produced at home. Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes
      with the aid of simple machines.
